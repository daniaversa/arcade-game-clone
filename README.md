# Classic Arcade Game - JS *Frogger* Clone
This is the third project for the **Udacity Front End Nanodegree**. It's a clone of the classic arcade game built with vanilla javascript using object-oriented principles and techniques. Also, it's not completely, but mostly written using ES6 syntax.

## How to Run the App

There are at least three options to run the game:
 - You can play it online by [clicking here](daniaversa.github.io/arcade-game/).
 - Download the repository as a .zip file and open the index.html file to play.
 - You can also clone the repository via Git Bash `$ git clone https://github.com/daniaversa/arcade-game-clone` and open the index.html file.

## How to Play

 - The goal is to cross all the way to the river.
 - Move by using the arrow keys.
 - Don't let the bugs get you, or you lose a life.
 - You have three lives, try to get as many crosses as possible to increase your highscore!
